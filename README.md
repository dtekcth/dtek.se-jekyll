# dtek.se
Datateknologsektionens homepage in Jekyll

The project is starting to take shape. The theme isn't completed yet but the general layout of the page is almost done.

Look at [https://jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com) for help in getting started with Jekyll.

## Building locally
Begin by editing `_config.yml` so that the `baseurl` corresponds to where you want to host the page. It is currently `/dtek.se/` since GitHub Pages won't do the paths right otherwise. Usually you want the `baseurl` to be empty.

Then you need to have Ruby installed.
Run `gem install jekyll bundler` to install Jekyll and the bundler locally. (Make sure to add the local gem directory to your PATH.)
Clone this project and go into its folder. There you run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to make the page served locally (it will rebuild if you change files (except the _config.yml)).
